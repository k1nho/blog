This year I want to really up my **DevOps** skills to the next level, as it is an area I am very interested in. After having such a great experience diving into **Kubernetes** services for the fantastic [NSDF Intersect](https://nationalsciencedatafabric.org/nsdf-intersect) project,
I decided that it is time to finally go full throttle into building my own **mini homelab**.

Usually, when people think of a homelab, they picture a **huge server rack** with boxes upon boxes upon boxes... and, of course, a money tree üòÅ. However, If you are like me, chances are you want
to build a **test lab**, one that can serve you to experiment different technologies.

The plan is to start from just a barebones Linux distro and end up running my own Kubernetes cluster. Along the way, I might look into
replacing Google photos with something like [Immich](https://immich.app/) or hosting a personal media server with [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/). The possibilities are truly endless in the world of homelab.

In this series, I will document my hardware, decision, and progress of the **Kinho's Homelab** adding piece by piece as I gain more knowledge. This is going to be fun! (and yes, we shall know [pain](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xu7X5-5U-b0)).
For this first article in the series, I‚Äôll cover setting up my first node and securing my devices under a tailnet with WireGuard using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/).

# Grandma's Laptop Has a Use!

As I mentioned earlier, the goal is to build a homelab that works as a playground for experimentation which means even your grandma‚Äôs old laptop will work too.

For me, that is an extremely old **Sony VAIO VPCEJ**, i3, 4GB RAM, and 500GB SSD. This machine is barely holding on under all the Windows bloatware, but it is ready to be reborn. To give new life to this poor soul, we will revitalize it with **Linux**.

# Ubuntu btw ?

When deciding which distro to flash onto the VAIO, I of course considered [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) btw, but it‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll wear the long bootcut pants for now and go with **Ubuntu**.

The simple fact is I actually do not mind Ubuntu. In fact, any Linux is 10‚Å∂ times better than Windows. It‚Äôs stable, and that is what we want here: a **solid environment**. Even though our main goal is experimentation, we do not want to deal with random breakages during setup. Don't get me wrong, Arch will get its shot in the future, but for now, it is **Ubuntu btw**.

If you have never flashed an OS before, you can follow these simple steps to [install Ubuntu server](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-server#1-overview). Keep in mind that the image used in that tutorial is for a server environment, which is fine if you plan to use the laptop as a server only.  
However, you can also go with the [Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview) image, if you intend to use the laptop as your daily driver as well.

# Laptop Heavy, Knees Weak, Arms Heavy

Ok, so the first issue I wanted to solve is this idea of accessing my VAIO through my Macbook via [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell), since I will be out of my local network somedays, and just setting up the whole ordeal with authorized keys would be a hassle.
Investigating more about how can I go about achieving it, I found the fantastic [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) and just wow I was amazed to what it had in store for this.

# All This For Free

**Tailscale** creates secure, point-to-point connectivity between devices using [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), forming what‚Äôs known as a **tailnet**. That means I can connect from my MacBook to my VAIO over SSH completely privately and, most importantly, securely.

Even better, the [personal](https://tailscale.com/pricing?plan=personal) tier is incredibly generous, incuding up to 100 devices and 3 users. Not to glaze over it, but the setup was _incredibly easy_, which is always something I love to praise when trying out a new product.

To set up my MacBook, I simply downloaded the [Tailscale client](https://tailscale.com/download/mac) from the official site and continued from there.  
For my VAIO running Linux, joining the mesh was as simple as running:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

I have achieved my goal, I can now connect from my Macbook to my VAIO via SSH privately and securely. There is one more thing to take care of to finish
securing the machine.

# Raise the Wall

We will do a few things to raise the wall. First, let's setup our **sshd_config** to only listen to its private IP
defined in Tailscale.

```plaintext {filename="sshd_config"}
ListenAddress <your-tailscale-ip>
```

Also, we will configure `ufw` to allow access to SSH only from Tailscale IP [CIDR](https://k1nho.github.io/blog/posts/what-is-cidr/) range with the following
command.

```bash
sudo ufw allow from '100.64.0.0/10' to any port 22
```

Configuring for IPV6 as well.

```bash
sudo ufw allow from 'fda7:115c:a1e0::/48' to any port 22
```

Lastly, we deny access from any other IP to SSH.

```bash
sudo ufw deny 22
```

```bash
sudo ufw deny OpenSSH
```

Lastly, let's enable the firewall.

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

# Adding MagicDNS + Tailscale SSH to Manage SSH Login

While we could SSH simply using the convention **hostname@tailscale-ip**, that becomes quite hard to remember specially as we add more
devices to the tailnet. Fortunately, we could make use of [MagicDNS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns) which allow us to automatically **register DNS
names for devices in our network**, that way we can substitute our raw tailscale IP for a readable name.

![Tailscale MagicDNS in the Dashboard]()

Lastly, I want to ditch SSH login via password, and even SSH keys as there is a configuration overhead per machine added. We can achieve this via
the [Tailscale SSH](https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh). To activate Tailscale SSH is as simple as starting tailscale with the following command.

```bash
sudo tailscale up --ssh
```

I really like this feature, since it eliminates SSH key management while maintaining security. Tailscale SSH encrypts the connection over **WireGuard** using **Tailscale node keys** that are automatically
generated and expire after each session. It even enforces authentication for high-risk connections (like root logins). Very neat!

Now, I can access my machine with a much better convention over SSH and simply authenticate on Tailscale to achieve an encrypted connnection as follows:

```bash
ssh hostname@machine-name
```

# Wrapping up

That‚Äôs a solid start for **Kinho‚Äôs Homelab**! We took an old VAIO laptop that was gathering dust and gave it a new purpose as our first node. We **installed Ubuntu** (sorry Arch üòÖ), configured secure remote access with **Tailscale**, and locked it down properly with `ufw` and SSH hardening.

I am also very excited to test out other features that Tailscale enables such as [serve](https://tailscale.com/kb/1312/serve) for **routing traffic from my devices
to a local service** running on my tailnet, and also [funnels](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) to **route traffic from the internet to a local service on my tailnet**.

With the foundation in place, the next step will be our installation of **Kubernetes** to start experimenting and slowly build up services. There is still a lot of fun ahead, but we are off to a great start.
